# LifeGuard

# What it does
The game would proceed in the same way, with players guessing letters in an effort to figure out the word the host chose. The words we gave the players to guess are based on programming terms, and they must do so letter by letter. Each line will have a blank location for a letter; if the letter is selected and is accurate, it will appear in the line; if not, it will be placed in a box to the side. And as for the characters, if the letter is incorrect, the water will rise, giving the player about 7 chances to guess the word. If they exhaust all of their chances without succeeding, the player's character will drown. However, if they manage to correctly guess the entire word, the player's character will survive. Also, to be inclusive, we provided gender pronouns and character customization for the characters. So, before beginning the game, you may select any character you like, give them a name, and enter their pronoun.

# Inspiration
Our project is called LifeGuard, the idea is based on the well-known hangman game, a popular game that everyone has played before. However, in order to make it uniquely ours, we gave it a small tweak. We chose to drown the character we designed rather than hang them.

# How we built it
# Challenges we ran into
Sadly, we were unable to complete our project. Although, we have both the front and back ends of it there were issues.

1. We didn't have them put together.
2. Getting the pages to alter was difficult.
3. We had problems connecting java and react
4. Problems connecting java buttons, and just connecting our entire project all at once These were the major issues we encountered. Our back end was largely finished, but the front end was where we were having all the issues.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are pleased with the amount of progress we were able to achieve on our project, despite the fact that we were unable to complete it. The fact that it was all of our first attempts at making a game made us feel really accomplished. It was amazing to just have the idea, and I'm sure that if we had more time, we would have learned more and progressed further than we have so far.

# What we learned
Some of our team members did view tutorials on HTML and CSS during this project in order to better grasp how it functioned.
We gained greater knowledge on how to use react when we had no prior knowledge. We made an effort to comprehend it and create our project.

# What's next for LifeGuard
We will undoubtedly continue to work on this during our time at WiC in order to make it functional and provide a playable game. Just finishing our first game would be a tremendous accomplishment as it was all of our team's first try at creating a game.

# Built With: 
java, javascript, maven, react
